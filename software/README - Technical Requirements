Technical Specifications of Implementation

The framework was developed based on Python on Ubuntu 16.04. 
The latest code version has been rendered compatible to TensorFlow 1.0.1. 
Other requirements, necessary for visualizations, for example, 
are Matplotlib 1.5.1 and sklearn 0.18.1. 
The machine on which training was conducted is equipped with an 
Intel Core i3-4160 CPU with 3.60 Ghz. We conducted our experiments 
on the CPU but training configurations of our code allow to run them 
on GPU in case the GPU-enabled TensorFlow version is installed. 
The code for the implemented framework including evaluation tasks and 
visualizations is available under https://github.com/kavchop/KGC.
